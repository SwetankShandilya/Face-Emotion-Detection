Overview:-

The primary objective of this project is to develop a real-time facial emotion recognition system. The system can identify and classify emotions from facial expressions using a CNN model.

Features:-

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Implemented a CNN model for accurate emotion recognition.

Python and Deep Learning Libraries: Utilized Python along with TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model.

Computer Vision Techniques: Applied techniques for image processing and feature extraction.

Preprocessing: Implemented data augmentation and normalization to enhance the training process.
