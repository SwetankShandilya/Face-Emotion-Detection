# Face Emotion Detection
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for facial emotion recognition. The project showcases proficiency in Python, deep learning libraries, and computer vision techniques. It includes preprocessing techniques such as data augmentation and normalization.

# Overview:-

The primary objective of this project is to develop a real-time facial emotion recognition system. The system can identify and classify emotions from facial expressions using a CNN model.

# Features:-

• Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Implemented a CNN model for accurate emotion recognition.

• Python and Deep Learning Libraries: Utilized Python along with TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model.

• Computer Vision Techniques: Applied techniques for image processing and feature extraction.

• Preprocessing: Implemented data augmentation and normalization to enhance the training process.
